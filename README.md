# MMORS Project

This repository contains the report and code for a final year project submitted in partial fulfilment of the MMORS (Masters in Mathematics, Operational Research and Statistics) degree at Cardiff University.

## Project Title
An Empirical Study on the Folk Theorem


### Abstract
This project consists of an empirical study into a class of theorems, entitled
'Folk Theorems', which are key in the repeated games theory. The aims of
the project include: an in-depth review of academic literature regarding the
theorems; the execution of a large experiment based on the
'original' folk theorem of [Friedman (1971)][https:/www.doi.org/10.2307/1911307] with the Iterated
Prisoner's Dilemma; and an analysis of the effects of different tournament
characteristics on the [p-threshold][The p-threshold is defined
as the probability of the tournament ending for which the
least probability of defection in Nash equilibria becomes zero.] described in the folk theorems. These
ideas are extended from a third year assignment, completed by the
author, in Game Theory.
