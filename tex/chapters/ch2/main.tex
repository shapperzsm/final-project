\chapter{Literature Review}

The folk theorems are a class of results which generally state that for repeated
games, any feasible and individually rational payoff vector can be achieved as a
subgame perfect equilibrium if the players are patient enough~\cite{Li2019}. The
origin of these theorems is unknown however written proof and
research involving these ideas first appeared in the
1970s~\cite{Friedman1971, aumann1976long, Rubinstein1979}. Since then, many
generalisations and refinements of
the ideas have been explored, for differing games, including:
games with private monitoring~\cite{Matsushima2004, Hoerner2006, Peski2012}, sequential
games~\cite{Gossner1996, Bhaskar1998, Wen2002} and games of complete
information~\cite{Benoit_1985, Abreu1994, Bernergard2019}, to
name a few. Due to the identification of further equilibria (as compared with
the stage game), which are key in predicting future behaviour, these theorems
have been commented on as `fundamental' in the theory of non-cooperative
games~\cite{Hoerner2006, }. On the other hand, the majority of the strategies used in the
proofs assume the identification of individual deviators~\cite{Masso1989}, which may not
be realistic in certain situations. Hence, an area of research on the so-called
`anti-folk theorems' was introduced~\cite{Masso1989, Yoon2001, Peski2012}. Folk theorems appear to still be an
active area of research today~\cite{Ikeda2020, Parras2020, Wang2020} with many differing applications.
Therefore, in this chapter, a review of the literature on this topic is provided
with papers ranging from the `original' ideas in the 1970s to applications of
the theorems in 2020. 


\section{First Papers}\label{sec:First_Papers}
\cite{Friedman1971} is often cited as the earliest work on Folk-type
theorems~\cite{Abreu1994, }. In \cite{Friedman1971}, infinitely repeated games with
discounting are considered. In particular, focus is on a class of strategies,
now known as \emph{grim trigger}, which are used to prove that, for any feasible
and individually rational payoff vector, there exists a discount parameter such
that a subgame perfect equilibrium with payoffs equal to that vector exist. This
is first shown under the constraints (in addition to those made on the strategy
and payoff spaces) identical stage games, constant discount parameter and unique
Nash equilibrium that is not Pareto optimal. However, a more general result is
then given which removes these restrictive conditions. \cite{Friedman1971} uses
the application of oligopoly throughout in addition to introducing the notation
of `temptation'. He motivates this through the explanation that `threat' is no
longer ``credible'' since players are unable to communicate in non-cooperative
games. On the other hand, `temptation' is said to be analogous to `threat'.

In contrast to this,~\cite{aumann1976long} presents folk theorems for infinite
games without discounting, assuming payoffs take a ``limiting average form''.
This choice is justified by stating that, as the discount rate approaches zero,
the limit of the discounted sum behaves similarly to the limiting average payoff
form. However, trigger strategies are still required in the proof. For
simplicity, two player games are assumed throughout. Two folk theorems are
proven in this paper with the latter one discussing subgame perfect equilibria
similar to~\cite{Friedman1971}, whilst the former is a more generic version of
the theorem. \cite{aumann1976long} discuss that, though the generic version of
the theorem does exist, the subgame perfect equilibrium points allow for more
`believable' behaviour. They conclude by considering an example in which payoffs
are discounted. A similar approach is taken in~\cite{Rubinstein1979}, with the
statement of a folk theorem for infinite games with no discounting and the
existence of subgame perfect equilibria. The only difference being the use of an
``overtaking criterion'' evaluation relation instead of a ``limit of the mean
criterion'' evaluation relation as in~\cite{aumann1976long}.


\section{Games with Complete Information}\label{sec:Games_with_Complete_Information}
\cite{Abreu1994, Bernergard2019} both study folk theorems of games assuming
complete information. That is, all players have common knowledge of payoff
functions, strategies etc. \cite{Abreu1994} focuses on the necessary and
sufficient conditions required for a folk theorem proof. They state that
feasibility and individual rationality of the payoff vector are necessary
conditions and also approximately sufficient conditions for a payoff to be in
the equilibrium. This is followed by a discussion on the full dimensionality
constraint first introduced by \cite{Fudenberg1986} and often used in proving
folk theorems. \cite{Abreu1994} highlight that the requirement of the convex
hull, of the set of feasible payoffs, to be equal to the number of players is a
sufficient condition. This is motivation for the main result of the paper; the
introduction of a `non equivalent utilities' condition, which is proved to be
sufficient and almost necessary for a folk theorem. The condition, as indicated
here, is weaker than the aforementioned full dimensionality condition. It only
requires ``no pair of players have equivalent utility functions''.

Similarly,~\cite{Bernergard2019} proves a folk theorem for complete information
games with subgame perfect equilibria however, instead of exponential
discounting (as in~\cite{Abreu1994, Fudenberg1986}), he assumes discounting is
present-biased. That is, the discount function implies a player is more willing
to alter an event in the future than altering an event today. The folk theorem
is proved in cases of where the player is time consistent (prefers to maximise
their initial preferences) and time inconsistent (prefers to maximise current
preferences) and the notion of `patience' is taken to be the sum of all discount
factors. Also considering time consistent and inconsistent players~\cite{Li2019}
discusses folk theorems with respect to time dependent discounting. In contrast
to~\cite{Bernergard2019}, the long-term characterisation of `patience' is taken
as discount factors at all stages uniformly converge to one. Motivation for the
study of time dependent discounting is explained by empirical studies which seem
to suggest that a player's time is unstationary, rather than the stationarity
assumed in most discounted game models.


\section{Games with (Imperfect) Private Monitoring}\label{sec:Games_with_(Imperfect)_Private_Monitoring}
In the late 1990s attention turned to games with imperfect monitoring. That is,
a player's actions can no longer be observed accurately, instead public or
private signals are detected~\cite{Durlauf2016}. Games with (imperfect) public
monitoring were the fist to be considered~\cite{Matsushima2004}. More recent
studies in this area include~\cite{Kandori2006, Chassang2011}.
\cite{Kandori2006} states that repeated games with public monitoring give a
suitable model for studying long term relationships. They state intuition
suggests that cooperation becomes easier to sustain as action observability
improves. However,~\cite{Kandori2006} continues to show that this intuition is
false, by considering a repeated public monitored game which satisfies ``the
limit perfect public equilibrium payoff set can achieve full efficiency
asymptotically as public information becomes less sensitive to hidden actions.''
They give an example which violates the sufficient condition given in Fudenberg
et al. (1994) [FIND THIS PAPER] yet a folk theorem can be obtained. This paper mainly focuses on
the Prisoner's Dilemma but, similarly to~\cite{Abreu1994}, they state an example
which satisfies the folk theorem without the full dimensionality condition. 

\cite{Chassang2011} consider the notion of a robust equilibrium to incomplete
information; that is, if the equilibrium yielded is near the original
equilibrium for all perturbed games consisting of a small independent and
identically distributed information shock. Conversely to \cite{Friedman1971},
they discuss the implication of grim trigger strategies not being robust when
the aim is to sustain cooperation. A folk theorem is proved in robust equilibria
for games of public monitoring, however~\cite{Chassang2011} highlights that a
much stronger condition is needed in comparison to Fudenberg et al. (1994) [FIND
THIS PAPER] full
dimensionality requirement.

As of 2004, repeated games with private monitoring was a relatively new area of
study~\cite{Matsushima2004}. In this paper, conditional independence of signals
is assumed in order to show a folk theorem for the IPD. Applications to
duopolies are then described. Another study to consider a folk theorem for the
IPD is~\cite{Ely2002}. Using a similar definition of robustness
to~\cite{Chassang2011},~\cite{Ely2002} proves that for a discounted Prisoner's
Dilemma with private monitoring technologies,a folk theorem with robust
equilibrium strategies can be obtained. In particular, they consider
almost-perfect private monitoring and a limit folk theorem (for sequential
equilibria) follows. In a similar paper,~\cite{Ely2005} introduce the idea of
``belief free'' equilibrium strategies; a property which implies the belief of
an opponent's history is not required when obtaining a best response. They use
these strategies in proving a folk theorem for the two-player Prisoner's Dilemma
however, for general games, the set of belief free payoffs is not large enough
to provide a folk theorem. Moreover,~\cite{Ely2005} highlight that for a larger
number of players the calculation of the payoff set becomes significantly
harder.

In contrast to this,~\cite{Horner2006} discusses a folk theorem using strategies
that, although are not belief free, still make beliefs ``irrelevant'' at the
start of each T-block of stage games. Their result is much more generic
than~\cite{Ely2005} since it applies to N-player finite games, under the
assumption of full dimensionality with private but almost-perfect monitoring.
The T-block strategies mentioned above are modified in~\cite{Yamamoto2009,
Yamamoto2012} such that they ``can support any vector in the belief free
equilibrium payoff set''. This modification results in belief free equilibrium
strategies. \cite{Yamamoto2009, Yamamoto2012} generalise the results from the
two-player Prisoner's Dilemma in~\cite{Ely2005} to the corresponding N-player game.


\section{Games with Communication}\label{sec:Games_with_Communication} 
Academics introduced games with communication to deal with the complications
faced with imperfect monitoring. For example, games with public monitoring can
obtain a folk theorem under weaker assumptions than those given in Fudenberg et
al. (1994) [FIND THIS PAPER] if communication is introduced~\cite{Kandori2003}.
In this paper, communication is a message taken from the set of possible actions
which the players give simultaneously after choosing an action and observing a
signal. \cite{Kandori2003} prove a folk theorem for symmetric games with four or
more players without the assumption of the number of signals relevant to the
number of actions.

Regarding private monitoring, ~\cite{Obara2009} claims repeated games are ``very
difficult to analyse without communication''. Thus examples of papers, proving
folk theorems for these games with communication, include~\cite{Fudenberg2008,
Obara2009, Li2010}. \cite{Fudenberg2008} proves a `Nash threats' folk theorem,
similar to~\cite{Friedman1971}, in the case of almost public information games
without independent signals for two players. In this paper, communication is
defined in the form of announcements where each set of announcements is the same
for all players. They justify the decision to only consider two player games by
highlighting that, although the results can be generalised, in certain cases it
can be seen as advantageous to have additional players. Similarly,
\cite{Obara2009} proves a Nash threats folk theorem for private monitoring games
with communication. He increases the number of environments where the folk
theorem is applicable through developing further the idea of ``delayed
communication'', as given in Compte [FIND THIS PAPER]. This paper, in addition,
uses the assumptions of correlated private signals and each player's deviation
from strategy is statistically identifiable from the other players' signals.
\cite{Li2010} also considers a model of private monitoring and communication
within games. He has the aim of increasing the number of applicable
environments for Kandori and Matsushima (1998) [FIND THIS PAPER] frequent
communication folk theorem. The paper states that Kandori and Matsushima (1998)
[FIND THIS PAPER] assumed only private signals were publicised in this theorem
but if other information was useful and communication was free and legal then
players would also want to share their actions. This motivates the reasoning of
the paper. However, assumptions of both full dimensionality, and the number of
actions and signals, are still required. 

Another paper which considers communication is~\cite{Block2016}, regarding self
referential games with codes of conduct. These codes are descriptions of how the
players and opponents should play. An application to computer algorithms is
provided. Two folk theorems are proved: one assuming common knowledge of the
codes of conduct, and the other where only certain players observe certain
codes. The latter is the main result of the paper and is motivated by the fact
that, often, individuals have good knowledge of those closest to them but not
the whole community. \cite{Block2016} obtain the sufficient condition that, with
public communication, if every player is observed by another two opponents, then
a folk theorem is yielded.


\section{Finite Horizon Games}\label{sec:Finite_Horizon_Games}
Another area of interest is the existence of folk theorem-type results for games
of finite repetition. \cite{Benoit_1985} explores the case of finitely-repeated
games of complete information and the associate subgame perfect equilibria. They
state that, despite the existence of games, when repeated finitely, ``produce no
non cooperative equilibrium outcomes'' besides those of the single game, there
may be subgame perfect equilibria of finite-repeated games when the
corresponding single game has multiple equilibria. Indeed, using their ``three
phase punishment'', \cite{Benoit_1985} prove that ``any rational and feasible
payoff vector can be obtained in the limit'', assuming the feasible payoff
region has dimension equal to the number of players and each player has two Nash
equilibrium payoff values. In a similar manner, \cite{ANGELOVA2011} considers an
alternative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma in which an additional strategy is
included. This gives a second pure-strategy equilibrium and a folk theorem
result for a finitely repeated version of this game. 

Although not strictly a finite game, \cite{Fujiwara-Greve2018} study a repeated
game in which players may ``strategically terminate'' it. In particular, this
involves the incorporation of a voting-step at the start of each repetition
where a certain number of players decide whether to keep interacting. This is
motivated by the increasing possibilities of ending business partnerships, due
to more technology and knowledge. They prove a general folk theorem for any
stage game (with the additional voting) which is satisfied ``for all majority
rules except the unanimous ending''. Indeed, for the unanimous ending rule, they
show that the theorem may not hold but sufficient conditions are
provided for when it is satisfied.

\section{Recent Applications}\label{sec:Recent_Applications}
In recent years, studies have been applying results of the folk theorem in
various areas for creating algorithms, for example. This section briefly
discusses a few of these.

\cite{Chowdhary2017} uses the folk theorem in the creation of a model which aims
to suppress the effects of distributed denial of service attacks. They claim
that all networks suffer from attacks to infrastructure and services. Thus, they
use the programmability of software defined network environments to perform a
game theoretic analysis. \cite{Chowdhary2017} create an algorithm for reward and
punishment based on the Nash folk theorem. Similarly,~\cite{Wang2020} make use
of the cooperative equilibrium solution from~\cite{Friedman1971}s folk theorem
to create an algorithm suggested to optimise a multi-period production planning
based real-time scheduling method for a job shop. Moreover,~\cite{Wang2018} uses
the result of the folk theorem in the IPD to study the cooperation rates of
varying agent strategies in a multi-agent system.

Another application of the folk theorem is an algorithm used to obtain
equilibria of a discounted repeated game~\cite{Parras2020}. \cite{Parras2020}
introduce a new algorithm, entitled ``Communicate & Agree'', which can find
equilibria in incomplete information, but perfect monitoring, games. Using the
folk theorem in the algorithm enables the payoffs obtained to be potentially
higher than those achieved by repeating the Nash equilibria of the single game.
However,~\cite{Parras2020} go on to highlight that the algorithm is not
guaranteed to always find equilibria. They say it is dependent on: the discount
factor, sampling density and whether it is a zero-sum game or not.
Finally,~\cite{Ikeda2020} discuss the potential of using game theoretic ideas in
quantum optimal transport. In particular, they define the Quantum Prisoner's
Dilemma and explore the possibility of a quantum folk theorem in relation to the
corresponding repeated game.
