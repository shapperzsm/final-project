\chapter{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere thanks and gratitude to
my project supervisors Dr Vince Knight and Henry Wilde for their continual
advice, support and invaluable ideas throughout the completion of this project.
You have always been willing to lend a hand or provide encouragement when
it was needed the most. You have assisted me
through what will probably be the largest project I will ever complete!

There are many people who have helped and supported me, both inside and outside
university, over the past four years of my undergraduate degree here at Cardiff
School of Mathematics. If I was to mention all the names, this would be longer
than my whole project! Therefore, this `thank you' is for all those who I have
had the pleasure of being taught by and working with during my degree. You have
made this journey an interesting and enjoyable one and I will continue to be
inspired by the passion all the lecturers have for what they do. 

Also, I would like to give special mention to Nikoleta, who, even though is in
her final few months of a PhD, found time
to talk and make sure I was still operating on this planet. You
encouraged me and always had a positive thing to say when I was convinced
everything was going to end terribly. So thank you very much for being
such a great friend and best of luck with the completion of your thesis.

Last but most certainly not least, I want to say a huge thank you to my Mum, Dad
and Zoe for their continual love and support. To say these have been a
challenging four years is an understatement. My
Mum, thank you for keeping me fuelled with coffee and biscuits through the long
days and for being a shoulder to cry on when necessary. I will give you enough
hair dye to cover all those grey ones I caused! Dad, thank you for making me
laugh with your terrible jokes, and finally Zoe, (yes, you are
getting a mention because, yes, you did play a key part) thank you for keeping
me sane and being a great sister.

To those I have forgotten to mention: my apologies and thank
you.
